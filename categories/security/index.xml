      <description>x64 and arm64 ABI in Linux TL;DR Ok, it has been a few months since Arch Linux announced that it will only provide x64 image in the future. Android also has been support x64 and arm64 for a long time. Seems that it&amp;rsquo;s true that x86 is on the way of out of time. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn some thing about the ABI in x64 and arm64.
PS: If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the ABI manual about Linux on X64/Arm64, there is no need to read this article.</description>
